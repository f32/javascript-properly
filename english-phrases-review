How does JavaScript deal with this
so you have a few traps to watch out for
All that’s been said
they work just as well
the code more difficult for humans to read
we haven’t indented the code.

Otherwise

If either of the conditions
if the left‐hand side is false, JavaScript doesn’t even bother checking the right‐hand side and just returns a result of false

it’s worth noting that JavaScript doesn’t like doing unnecessary work
Although
In any other circumstance, the result will be false

This is very similar

You should have a general idea
