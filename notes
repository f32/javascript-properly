Before executing any code, the JavaScript engine goes through all the code and checks for syntax errors, or code that breaches JavaScript’s rules. If the engine finds a syntax error, the browser deals with it as usual; your try clause never runs and therefore cannot handle syntax errors.


Safari’s story is similar to IE’s. Safari’s rendering engine is called Webkit, and the folks that write and maintain Webkit built a separate tool, codenamed Drosera, that contained the tools similar to the other browsers. It was a separate download, and it required you to attach it to a specific Safari/ Webkit window. Today, Safari includes a tool called Web Inspector, and it provides the functionality you would expect from a browser‐based suite of tools.


Chrome is built using a heavily modified version of WebKit
